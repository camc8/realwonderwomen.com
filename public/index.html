                <p>
                    Debora de Sola Habsburg is a multicultural actress, director, producer, and writer. She was born in
                    El Salvador to German and Spanish immigrant parents and has French Nationality. Debora lived in
                    various countries in Latin America, as well as Europe and the U.S, helping her become fluent in
                    English, Spanish, French, and German, as well as proficient in Italian and Portuguese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in a country with extreme poverty at a time of war, and living through my husband’s
                    accident, which left him handicapped, enhanced my sensibility and empathy for a myriad of human
                    issues that connect us all. Having lived in eight countries, and had extensive travel, has taught me
                    to adapt, and embrace, social and cultural differences. My diverse background has given me a deep
                    insight into the common aspects of the human journey, which I feel have given a range and depth to
                    my characters. When I realized the gift that storytelling and entertainment play in helping channel
                    difficult circumstances, and in enriching people’s lives, I chose to dedicate my life to acting,
                    producing, and writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2014 I founded Pollination Pictures to develop films that connect us to another person’s
                    experience or culture, in order to broaden limited perceptions, create greater insight, and
                    hopefully inspire audiences to become more accepting and fight bigotry. My filmmaking debut, Freddie
                    of Wynwood, competed at the Miami Film Festival, was streamed nationally on PBS, and is now
                    available on Amazon Prime. The recognition we received inspired me to co-produce my second film,
                    Salvador, which also received significant national and international acclaim affording me a “Best
                    Actress” award, as did my third short Swear by Apollo, which also earned a “Best Actress” and “Best
                    Film Award” at the Latitude Film Festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2018 I co-founded Gaia Performing Arts, to showcase the diversity of cultures in Miami, through
                    original and adapted content, emphasising the stories of women’s struggles and triumphs. Gaia
                    utilizes art to build bridges within the local community, to empower women, and to expand their
                    roles and place in society.
